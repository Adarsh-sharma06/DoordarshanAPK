## Introduction

This project is designed to be a simple yet powerful React application. It's ideal for learning and testing React components, hooks, and state management. Feel free to explore and contribute!

## Prerequisites

Before running this app, ensure you have the following software installed:

- **Node.js**: [Download Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
- **npm**: Comes with Node.js. [npm Docs](https://docs.npmjs.com/)

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run the following commands:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

Any changes you make to the code will automatically reload the page. Additionally, any lint errors will appear in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in interactive watch mode.\
For more information about running tests in React, check out the [React Testing Library documentation](https://testing-library.com/).

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production into the `build` folder.\
It bundles everything for optimal performance, minifies the code, and includes hash filenames for caching purposes. You can deploy the contents of the `build` folder to any static web hosting service.

### `npm run eject`

**Warning: This is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you cannot undo it.**

If you need full control over the configuration (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc.), you can eject the project. This removes the abstraction and gives you direct control, but it also means youâ€™ll be responsible for managing the configurations. [Learn more about ejecting here](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/advanced-configuration).
